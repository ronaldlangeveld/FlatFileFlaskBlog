Welcome to me new blog.. again..

I'm convinced I'm the absolute worst person at being happy with how my site look... I guess style changes all the time. 

*So what's new?*

I got rid of Wordpress.. Sorry Matt.
I just needed something a bit simpler and more importantly, something I could maintain my blog via git. Yes GIT! 
I'm a huge fan of git. 
It just feels like I have so much more control over what's happening on my site.

What happened?

Actually, I played around with multiple Flat-File CMS's. I didn't wanna deal with databases anymore. And I wanted to find a way that makes a potential migration as easy as possible and reduce the risk of losing what I post. And git is definitely the way for that. Everything gets saved on Github as a backup. At worst someone can git clone my repository... but why would anyone want to copy my blog.

So for now I'm running a little CMS called Pico. So lightweight, it doesn't even have an admin section. Everything I write and post is in Markdown, meaning I can just write my blog post using my text editor, save it as a .md file and boom its up. 

I'm still keen to start a project like this in Python/Django that makes theming a bit easier compared to Pico, but so far I've had a good experience using Pico. 

Anyway, I will be doing my best to update this as frequently as possible.. I haven't really written in over a year so I guess this is gonna be a challenge. 

But hey, its 2018 LETS DO THIS!!
